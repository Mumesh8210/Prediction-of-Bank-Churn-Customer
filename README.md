bu# Prediction-of-Bank-Churn-Customer
*This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can predict the likelihood of a bank customer churning or leaving the bank. Customer churn is a critical issue in the banking industry, and 
being able to predict it can help banks take proactive steps to retain customers and minimize revenue los*




*The first step in this project would be to gather the necessary data. This data can be obtained from the bank's database or from external sources such as customer surveys or other market research. Once the data has been collected, it will need to be pre-processed and cleaned to remove any missing or irrelevant information.*



*Next, the data will be divided into two sets: a training set and a testing set. The training set will be used to train the machine learning model, while the testing set will be used to evaluate its performance*


*Various machine learning algorithms can be used to develop the classification model, such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, or support vector machines. The performance of the model can be evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.*


**Once the model has been trained and evaluated, it can be used to predict whether a new customer is likely to churn or not. This information can be used by the bank to take appropriate measures such as offering special promotions or incentives to retain customers who are at risk of churning.
Overall, the goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can help banks to identify customers who are likely to churn and take appropriate measures to retain them.**

Subject: Request for Guidance on DSO Critical Transaction Reporti
Hi Henry,

I hope you're doing well.

I wanted to reach out to request your guidance on an issue we’re experiencing with the DSO Critical Transaction application.

We use this application to pull daily volume data. However, we noticed that from March 25th to April 8th, no data was available. After raising an INC ticket, we were informed that the department name was changed from RCO PEMS to IES Auto Assign on March 25th, and then reverted back to RCO PEMS on April 8th. Since the update on April 8th, we are again able to access current data, but data for the affected dates (March 25th–April 8th) is still missing.

When we followed up with the LOB, we were informed that this is not under ADS control. As per Kelsey, DSO Critical Transaction reporting has moved to Technology with Embedded IT, and it’s now owned by the Indigo PEMS/DMM partner team.

Could you please help confirm who currently supports or owns this report, or guide me to the appropriate contact who can assist further?

Thank you in advance for your help!
