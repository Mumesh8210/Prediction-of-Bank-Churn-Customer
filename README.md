# Prediction-of-Bank-Churn-Customer
*This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can predict the likelihood of a bank customer churning or leaving the bank. Customer churn is a critical issue in the banking industry, and being able to predict it can help banks take proactive steps to retain customers and minimize revenue los*




*The first step in this project would be to gather the necessary data. This data can be obtained from the bank's database or from external sources such as customer surveys or other market research. Once the data has been collected, it will need to be pre-processed and cleaned to remove any missing or irrelevant information.*



*Next, the data will be divided into two sets: a training set and a testing set. The training set will be used to train the machine learning model, while the testing set will be used to evaluate its performance*


*Various machine learning algorithms can be used to develop the classification model, such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, or support vector machines. The performance of the model can be evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.*


**Once the model has been trained and evaluated, it can be used to predict whether a new customer is likely to churn or not. This information can be used by the bank to take appropriate measures such as offering special promotions or incentives to retain customers who are at risk of churning.
Overall, the goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can help banks to identify customers who are likely to churn and take appropriate measures to retain them.**
Here's the modified code that checks if the output file already exists and if the "population" sheet already contains data. If it does, the code will overwrite the existing data instead of appending to it:

Here is a Python code snippet that calculates the required details:


Here's the modified Python code to get the first and last working days of the previous month:

```
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
import calendar

today = datetime.today()
first_day_of_current_month = today.replace(day=1)
last_day_of_previous_month = first_day_of_current_month - timedelta(days=1)
first_day_of_previous_month = last_day_of_previous_month.replace(day=1)

Get the first working day of the previous month
first_working_day_of_previous_month = first_day_of_previous_month
while first_working_day_of_previous_month.weekday() >= 5:  # 5 = Saturday, 6 = Sunday
    first_working_day_of_previous_month += timedelta(days=1)

Get the last working day of the previous month
last_working_day_of_previous_month = last_day_of_previous_month
while last_working_day_of_previous_month.weekday() >= 5:  # 5 = Saturday, 6 = Sunday
    last_working_day_of_previous_month -= timedelta(days=1)

print("First Working Day of Previous Month:", first_working_day_of_previous_month.strftime('%d%m%Y'))
print("Last Working Day of Previous Month:", last_working_day_of_previous_month.strftime('%d%m%Y'))
```

```
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

def get_previous_month_details():
    today = datetime.today()
    first_day_of_current_month = today.replace(day=1)
    last_day_of_previous_month = first_day_of_current_month - timedelta(days=1)
    first_day_of_previous_month = last_day_of_previous_month.replace(day=1)

    previous_month_number = last_day_of_previous_month.month
    previous_month_year = last_day_of_previous_month.year

    first_day_of_previous_month_str = first_day_of_previous_month.strftime('%d%m%Y')
    last_day_of_previous_month_str = last_day_of_previous_month.strftime('%d%m%Y')

    return {
        'previous_month_number': str(previous_month_number).zfill(2),
        'previous_month_year': str(previous_month_year),
        'first_day_of_previous_month': first_day_of_previous_month_str,
        'last_day_of_previous_month': last_day_of_previous_month_str,
        'date_range': f"{first_day_of_previous_month_str} - {last_day_of_previous_month_str}"
    }

details = get_previous_month_details()
print(details)
